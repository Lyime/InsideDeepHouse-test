                                <p><strong>Technics SL-1200MK7 Direct-Drive Professional DJ Turntable
                                  <p>As the go-to choice of DJs the world over, the SL-1200 Series has long been a dominant presence on the global music scene.
                                     Today the brand continues to set the industry standard as the direct drive turntable par excellence.</p>
                                  
                                  <p><img class="img-logo " src="Images/technics sl.jpg" alt=""></p>
                                  
                                  <p>The SL-1200 Direct Drive Turntable has continued evolving as the world standard DJ turntable. It is the mission imposed only on SL-1200 series.</p></strong></p>
                                  <p>The direct drive motor (D.D. Motor) formed the core of the SL-1200 Series. In addition to providing unparalleled accuracy, the D.D. 
                                    Motor technology that was introduced in 1970 offered reliability for long-term use with its excellent durability. This further evolved with the SL-1200/1210MK7, and achieved even higher sound quality as the Coreless Direct Drive Motor.</p>
                                  <p>The SL-1200/1210MK7 comes with a static balance S-shaped tonearm to carry on the Technics tradition. The tonearm moves in a unique arc as it tracks the record disc, and reproduces music with high fidelity. 
                                    The bearing section features a high-precision bearing structure. The tonearm provides high tracking performance without stylus skipping even under hard usage such as scratching.</p>
                                  <p>Each insulator foot consists of an internal spring and rubber, and the bottom surface is covered with a cushion material. They effectively shut out vibration even in a loud sound environment. 
                                    If the turntable cannot be set up on a perfectly level surface, its height and inclination can be adjusted by turning individual insulator feet.</p>
                                  <p>Pitch control on the SL-1200 was originally utilised for the precise adjustment of rotation speed. Club DJs began using this function to match the pitch between two tracks to achieve smooth transition. 
                                    This technique led to the explosive popularity of the SL-1200 worldwide. The current vertical fader was first installed on the SL-1200MK2. This change was made to simplify use for DJs. 
                                    The MK7 has newly incorporated full digital control to enable accurate and stable adjustment within the range of Â±8/16%.</p>
                                   <p>The light that illuminates the stylus and its position on the record was featured for the first time on the SL-1200MK2. Technics opted for a popup-type light, not a detachable type, for easier use. 
                                    The SL-1200/1210MK7 comes with a white LED that offers high brightness and a long life. The illumination was improved and its range was reviewed to ensure optimal visibility.</p>
                                   <p>The original purpose of the strobe light, a standard feature on all models from the first-generation SL-1200, was to enable an accurate visual adjustment of the rotation speed. Since Technics incorporated quartz control, 
                                    in models starting with the MK2, the rotation speed became extremely stable; thus, there was no need for the strobe anymore. However, 
                                    DJs wanted the familiar strobe on the turntables they use, so it is still provided on the current model. The SL-1200/1210MK7 comes with an LED strobe that can be set to illuminate in red or blue.</p>
                                  <p>The SL-1200 Series was originally developed in pursuit of pure audio performance. The vibration-absorbing cabinet and insulators suppress undesirable noise, while the gimbal suspension tonearm provides high tracking performance for high-fidelity sound reproduction. The design has not been changed much for more than 40 years, thus retaining the ultimate functional beauty achieved in the first-generation model. 
                                    The SL-1200/1210MK7 has also further unified the all black design scheme, even in every part, to become more stylish and attractive.</p>

                <p>PLAYS WELL WITH OTHERS - 
                  Whether you connecting to a turntable, television, computer, cell phone, whatever - these powered speakers work with anything.
                  Equipped with an integrated phono pre-amp, BluetoothÂ® wireless technology, digital optical, analog RCA and USB inputs, 
                  making these powered speakers your new best friend.</p>
                  <p>Dynamic Bass EQ - 
                    As the human ear perceives frequencies differently with variations in output, Klipsch Reference powered speakers will dynamically match the earâs ability to hear lower frequencies. 
                    Typically, only available with audio/video receivers, dynamic volume is a first for Klipsch powered monitors. 
                    What you get is powerful bass whether the listening volume is low, cranked up or somewhere in between.</p> 
                    <p>CUSTOM-TUNED AMPLIFICATION - 
                      Reference powered speakers leverage independent, ultra-low noise amplifiers that are custom designed to maximize system performance and eliminate the need for external amplification. 
                      That means that world-class Klipsch engineers have full control of the signal path. We've tuned the components to be an absolute perfect match, 
                      making the system sound incredibly immersive and fills your room with incredible acoustics.</p>
                      <p>TractrixÂ® Horn Technology - 
                        Klipsch exclusive 90x90Âº TractrixÂ® horn technology ensures that the speaker high-frequency energy is aimed at the listener and reduces artificial reverb or filtering caused by indirect sound bouncing off of walls. 
                        Using this proprietary focused technology gives you the best clarity, dynamics, and detail from your movies and music.</p>
                        <p>LINEAR TRAVEL SUSPENSION TWEETER WITH KAPTONÂ® SUSPENSION - 
                          Klipsch exclusive Linear Travel Suspension (LTS) aluminum tweeter minimizes distortion for enhanced, detailed performances. Using Kapton, an extremely light and rigid material, in the tweeter suspension provides high efficiency and improves resolution and detail. 
                          LTS tweeters are a hallmark of Klipsch speakers, making them some of the best speakers in the world.</p> 
                          <p>Spun Copper IMG Woofers - 
                            Injection Molded Graphite (IMG) woofer cones are exceptionally light while being extremely rigid â providing remarkable low frequency response, with minimal cone breakup and distortion. 
                            When paired with the Tractrix Horn-Loaded LTS Tweeter, it provides speaker efficiency highest in its class.</p> 
                            <p>Sleek Design - 
                              Exposed fasteners, low profile magnetic grilles and a scratch-resistant, textured wood grain vinyl give these powered bookshelf speakers a polished, modern appearance.</p> 
                              <p>Seamless Subwoofer Integration - 
                                The Reference powered speakers include a sub-out line that allow you to seamlessly add a subwoofer to your stereo system to enhance low frequencies even further.</p>

                <p>The Best Noise-Canceling Earbuds1 - 
                  Noise cancellation does not get better than the WF-1000XM5 earbuds. The earbuds reduce external noise over a wide bandwidth, from low to high frequencies. It contains two proprietary processors that cancel more external noise than ever, a new high-performance driver unit Dynamic Driver X, dual feedback microphones, and innovative Noise-Isolation Earbud Tips for a more stable fit. Real-time noise canceling processing can be optimized to provide the best performance for your environment so you will hear a big difference especially in airplanes, trains, or buses. 
                  The WF-1000XM5 now feature three microphones on each earbud, including dual feedback mics, which improve low-frequency cancellation performance. Newly developed by Sony, the Integrated Processor V2 unlocks the potential of the HD Noise Canceling Processor QN2e. The unique combination of technology controls the six microphones, across both ears, to deliver unprecedented noise-canceling quality that can be adapted to provide the best performance for your environment.  
                  The specially designed driver unit Dynamic Driver X, able to reproduce lower frequencies, has been improved using a dome-edge separation structure that combines different materials, allowing for a more accurate generation of cancellation waves in lower frequencies.</p> 
                  <p>Expertly engineered for astonishing sound quality - 
                    Thanks to the specially designed Dynamic Driver X, the WF-1000XM5 lets you experience rich and more detailed vocals. The diaphragm structure combines several different materials for the dome and the edge, achieving low distortion and a clear sound quality.   
                    By combining Sony's newly developed Noise-Canceling Processor QN2e and Integrated Processor V2, the WF-1000XM5 incorporates precision 24-bit audio processing and high-performance analogue amplification. The result is low distortion and crystal-clear audio reproduction.         
                    The WF-1000XM5 supports High-Resolution Audio Wireless, thanks to LDAC, over industry-adopted audio coding technology. LDAC transmits approximately three times more data than conventional Bluetooth audio for exceptional High-Resolution Audio quality that is closer than ever to studio recording.  
                    Using Edge-AI, DSEE Extreme upscales compressed digital music files in real-time, including those from popular streaming services. It dynamically recognizes each song's instrumentation, musical genre, and individual elements, and restores high-range sound lost in compression.   
                    Head tracking ensures a realistic and compelling listening experience by automatically adjusting sound fields to compensate for your head movement. Sounds are precisely aligned with your smartphone screen, even as you move, to completely involve you in your viewing by connecting to compatible smartphones/service.</p>

                    <p>Sony's best ever call quality - 
                      Mute the outside world with Precise Voice Pickup Technology and advanced audio signal processing. The person on the other end of the call will hear your voice clearly, even when you are in noisy situations. The WF-1000XM5's noise reduction algorithm was developed with AI machine learning using more than 500 million voice samples to suppress ambient noise, increase accuracy, and extract your voice clearly in various environments.  
                      Bone conduction sensors pick up the vibration of your voice directly from your skull bones, helping to isolate your speech from ambient sounds and background noise, for clear calls even in loud environments. An AI-based noise-reduction algorithm based on Deep Neutral Network (DNN) processing and bone conduction sensors allows your voice to come through clear and natural even in a noisy environment. 
                      The WF-1000XM5 also has a wind noise-reduction structure and a mesh wrap in the microphone that will minimize noise during calls so you can be heard clearly in windy conditions..</p>
                      <p>Comfortable and beautifully designed - 
                        The WF-1000XM5 earbuds feature an improved, glossy texture and more luxurious feel that fit comfortably in your ears while keeping out external sounds. By downsizing the earbud body and optimizing the placement of the components, the earbud is now approximately 25% smaller and 20% lighter than the WF-1000XM4. The size of the charging case has also been reduced, so it will fit even more sleekly in your pocket.
                        Noise-Isolation Earbud Tips feature a unique polyurethane foam material which reduces noise in the high-frequency range. Soft and elastic, they maximize the contact area between the earbud tip and the ear canal, insulating your sound and reducing noise. It also improves adhesion to the ear canal for a more secure, stable fit.                         
                        The WF-1000XM5 earbuds feature a shape with an ergonomic design for a more stable fit that was designed by utilizing extensive ear-shape data collated since introducing the world's first in-ear earbuds in 1982. Sony's continuous evaluation of different ear shapes and sensitivities has helped design an ideal earbud shape, secure and comfortable for almost everybody.</p> 
                        <p>Seamless listening experience -

          <p><strong>"In 1978 Renzo Rosso started Diesel with the intention of creating the worldâs most innovated denim. Amidst a worldwide oil crisis, during which diesel was considered to be an alternative fuel, Renzo liked the idea of his brand to be known as an alternative jeans brand, 
            in contrast to the prevalent casual wear giants that had come before.</p>
            <p>Renzo intended to reach the entire world since the brandâs very inception, making the word âdieselâ an international term pronounced equally all over the world, the perfect name for his endeavor. Since its start, 
              Diesel has used âFor Successful Livingâ as a slogan for the brandâs DNA.</p></p>
              <p>Through a long and storied history of strong, ironic and playful campaigns, Diesel has become a leader in advertising as well as in fashion. Where the world zigged, Diesel zagged, and in the 35 years since its founding, the brand still embraces the same ethos. Diesel has over 5,000 points of sale worldwide with over 400 monobrand stores. Between 1978 and 2012, 
                the company has produced more than 2,000 different washes of denim.
                <img class="img-logo " src="Images/Diesel SNEAKER white.jpg" alt="">
                <p>OTB is an international fashion group, powering a range of global, unconventional brands, including Diesel, Maison Margiela, Marni, Viktor&Rolf, and Jil Sander. The group also controls and manages the Staff International and Brave Kid companies and holds a minority investment in L.A. brand Amiri. OTB embodies the brave, innovative and unapologetic spirit and vision of its founder and president Renzo Rosso, who disrupted the world of fashion with an open-minded, highly creative mentality, aimed at âbuilding not the biggest, but the most alternative fashion group,â as he stated. As its name suggests, - OTB stands for âOnly The Braveâ - the group pushes boundaries and challenges established rules to re-define the world of fashion and lifestyle, by fostering the creativity of international talents. Through its know-how and state-of-the-art facilities, the group supports the brands in its portfolio in the development of authentic, individual concepts and sustainable, successful businesses.

                <p>Embracing consumer-centric digital innovation and advanced technologies, OTB transforms ideas into distinctive and responsible creations targeting unconventional, forward-thinking individuals.</p>Dieselâs philosophy has remained unwavering since its inception: passion, self-expression, and a determination to change the game. Now we commit to taking on a bold new challenge, confronting the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the fashion industry at large, a challenge Diesel is ready to face - head on. This is why we launched our strategy, Diesel For Responsible Living which outlines our commitment to taking action for the benefit of current and future generations, ensuring Dieselâs continuing success in a changing world, based on four pillars:</p>

                 <p>Be the Alternative</p>

                 <p>Promote Integrity</p> 
                 <p></p> Our commitment to alternative material and production processes goes hand in hand with our belief that our denim should be made to last.

                    <p><img class="img-logo " src="Images/vw id2 electric front.webp" alt="">Volkswagen plans to introduce up to ten new all-electric vehicles to the global market by 2026. As part of this strategy CEO of VW Passenger Cars, Thomas SchÃ¤fer, was recently on hand to unveil the first of these products, the ID. 2all concept..</p>
                    <p><strong>A brand with a legacy of introducing segment-defining compact vehicles, the ID. 2all concept is said to offer the spaciousness of a modern Golf, within the exterior dimensions of a Polo.
                      Set to be the first front-wheel drive car to be built on an updated Modular Electric Drive (MEB) architecture, this new entry point into Volkswagenâs ID. family of all-electric vehicles is slightly shorter than a current generation Polo (by 24mm) yet stands 61mm wider and almost 100mm taller than its compact hatch sibling. At 2600mm, the ID. 2allâs wheelbase is closer to that of the Golf than it is to the Polo. 
                      Luggage space is listed as a generous 490-litres.
                    <p>While simultaneously introducing Volkswagenâs new design language, the significant news regarding the planned 2025 introduction of the ID. 2all is that the brandâs commitment towards a retail price of less than 25 000 euros (which currently translates to less than R500 000) for its new compact car.
                    âWe are transforming the company rapidly and fundamentally â with the clear objective of making Volkswagen a genuine Love Brand,â says SchÃ¤fer. âThe ID. 2all shows where we want to take the brand. We want to be close to the customer and offer top technology in combination with fantastic design.</p>
                    <p><img class="img-logo " src="Images/vw id2 electric inside.webp" alt=""></p></strong></p>
                    <p>  We are implementing the transformation at pace to bring electric mobility to the masses.â
Complementing a clean, powerful stance, the ID. 2allâs interior features high-quality finishes and materials while showcasing a user-friendly, 12.9-inch infotainment system and a return to physical controls and dials â something SchÃ¤fer feels strongly about. This includes classic audio system volume controls and dedicated climate control settings.
The car will also feature modern driver assistance technologies like Travel Assist, IQ.Light and Electric Vehicle Route Planner.
Available with a choice of either a 38- or 56kWh battery, the latter installation will allow the ID. 2all an operating range of up to 450 km. Able to charge via 125kW infrastructure, the carâs battery can be topped-up from 10% to 80% in just 20 minutes.</p>
<P>Delivering 166kW to the front wheels, Volkswagen says its newest all-electric package will sprint from 0-100 km/h in less than 7 seconds, and reach a top speed of 160 km/h.
âWe are transferring the typical Volkswagen virtues to the new world of mobility: top quality and workmanship, outstanding software and digital services with genuine added value. The focus here is always on the needs and requirements of our customers,â says Imelda LabbÃ©, Member of the Brand Board of Management responsible for Sales, Marketing and Aftersales.</P>
